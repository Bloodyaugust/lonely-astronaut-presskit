description: |
    Lonely Astronaut is a one-button arcade game in which you pilot the corpse of a long-abandoned astronaut floating in a cosmic graveyard. In the process, you might find out something about the human condition. But probably not.

history: |
    Lonely Astronaut started life as a simple Ludum Dare project made by developer Greyson Richey, with the theme "A Small World." The original project featured a small perpetually spinning astronaut, a jetpack, and asteroids to avoid, along with a simple score timer. Greyson later teamed up with artist/animator Nick Lives to turn it into a full-fledged product in the late summer of 2017. The game was retooled and rethemed to evoke a bleaker, Space Odyssey-like aesthetic and a darker sense of humor, with more in-depth arcade progression and stylings to go with it.
features: |
    - "**Pilot a Corpse with a Single Button:** With only the ability to thrust the Astronaut's body around with its malfunctioning jetpack, Lonely Astronaut is accessible but brutal."
    - "**Discover Cosmic Truths:** The wonders of space will reveal themselves to you as you play. If only you were alive to see these truths unfold."
    - "**Unlock Cosmetics:** Play dress-up with your corpse because that's healthy."
    - "**Feel Existential Dread:** A friendly reminder that you and I are all going to die someday, probably sooner than we'd like to think."
